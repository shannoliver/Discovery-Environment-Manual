The list is not all-inclusive, but does mention all of the larger issues. iPlant personnel have access to the Core Software project in iPlant's JIRA issue tracker which has a comprehensive listing at <a href="https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/jira/" target="_blank">https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/jira/</a>.</p><p>This list also includes information about the Tree Reconciliation (TR), Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS), Ultra High Throughput Sequencing (UHTS), and Trait Evolution (TE) projects.</p>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_2" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Notifications</h2>		 <p><strong>Improvements from 0.2.1</strong><br /><i>Triggered notifications</i>               </p><ul><li>Users can now view triggered notifications from within the View Notifications window.</li></ul><p><i>Categorized notifications</i>              </p><ul><li>Notifications have been categorized as either &quot;transient&quot; or &quot;persistent&quot;.</li><li>Persistent notifications are related to file import or upload (success or failure) and analysis (success or failure). These appear in View Notifications and remain until a user chooses to delete them. To filter these notifications by type, users may select either the data icon, the analysis icon, or by utilize the drop-down menu in View Notifications.</li><li>Transient notifications are related to file deletion, job submission, and issues where the ability to view an output (success or failure) is not available. These are presented to the user as a pop-up window in the lower right corner of the DE.</li></ul><p><i>Adjustable notification display</i>              </p><ul><li>Notifications are displayed in descending date/time order by default; however, this is adjustable. Point your cursor at the right hand of the Created Date column header will cause a down arrow to appear. Select the arrow to choose a sorting preference from the drop-down menu. Also shown is the ability to limit what columns are displayed.</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues</strong><br /><i>Email notifications</i>              </p><ul><li>There is currently an interface available to receive an email notification for long running jobs; however, support services for this are not currently integrated. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Notification persistence</i>              </p><ul><li>Currently, refreshing the browser will eliminate transient notifications from the main window. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Display</i>              </p><ul><li>Some of the text for the notification type may appear to be truncated. This can be fixed by moving the heading bar in the View Notifications window to allow for more room in the column.</li></ul><p><strong>Future plans</strong><br /><i>Additional notification types</i>              </p><ul><li>In a subsequent release, general notifications related to iPlant services and announcements will be added. Examples of such notifications include system downtime, community data availability, new tool/analysis capability, and others.</li></ul><p><i>Icon highlighting for notification type</i>              </p><ul><li>Creating a feature that informs users of new notifications is being designed. Highlighting the appropriate icon to indicate job or data upload/import completion will do this. The current proposal is similar to notification behavior on Facebook, where the icons are enabled when a notification is available with a numeric representation of the number of notifications.</li></ul><p><i>Email notifications</i>              </p><ul><li>The initial version will appear soon, but expanded and additional features are planned for future releases.</li></ul><p><i>Collaboration notifications</i>              </p><ul><li>A new notification icon will be created for collaborations. The details of this notification type are still in the requirements gathering phase.</li></ul>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_3" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Analyses (jobs that are run in the DE)</h2>		 <p><strong>Improvements from 0.2.1</strong><br /><i>0.3.0 release goal</i>            </p><ul><li>The goal of the 0.3.0 release was to enable submitting a job to a Condor cluster in a uniform manner for tools integrated into the DE. A service was created and hardcoded executables from 0.2.1 were rewritten.</li></ul><p><i>Creation of an OSM, Notification Agent, and JEX</i>            </p><ul><li>An Object State Management system (OSM), a Notification Agent and a Job Execution Framework (JEX) were created.</li></ul><p><i>Metadata tool description</i>            </p><ul><li>The ability to describe tools with metadata (in JSON format) was implemented.</li></ul><p><i>Flexible tool integration</i>            </p><ul><li>The Job Execution Framework (JEX) allows collaborators to integrate their own tools by describing the metadata (in JSON format) that is sent to the JEX and is stored by the Object State Management system (OSM). This change enables an easily repeatable process and a somewhat simple mechanism for users to integrate tools and customized implementations or uses of those tools (which we call analyses) into the DE. Core Software personnel are still needed to perform part of the process, but we have completed the first step toward making this easier for end users.</li></ul><p><strong>Known Issues</strong><br /><i>Progress monitoring</i>            </p><ul><li>States such as &quot;running&quot; or &quot;completed&quot; for submitted jobs are displayed in the Perform Analyses window.  More granular progress reporting (eg, &quot;Job is 50% complete&quot;) is being discussed for a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Job naming</i>            </p><ul><li>The name of the job given by the user is displayed in the Perform Analysis window; however, the description entered for the job is not displayed. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>End date</i>            </p><ul><li>The user is currently not returned an &quot;end date&quot; completion time for the job executed. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Display of items in Perform Analysis window            </i></p><ul><li>Due to the length of some of the items displayed in the Perform Analysis window, longer items may appear to be truncated. Users can adjust the width of column headings and view all details. Users can also maximize the Perform Analysis window to view these items in greater detail. Adjustments to this display are being discussed.</li></ul><p><i>Display of outputs</i>            </p><ul><li>The user will be notified of a completed job in View Notifications, as well as via a &quot;completed&quot; status in the Perform Analysis window. The user can then select &quot;view outputs&quot; from the View Analysis window (or select the job name from the View Notifications window) and will be directed to the location of the outputs in the Manage Data window. These outputs are located in a generated folder that contains the name of the job and a key identifier. The key identifier is currently a large sequence. This will need to be modified to provide a user-friendly interface. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Same name for output file and job</i>            </p><ul><li>The name of the output file should be the name of the job executed with &quot;outputs&quot; or &quot;out&quot; appended. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Selection of folder for outputs</i>            </p><ul><li>The current workflow automatically generates a folder for outputs. Future implementations will allow a user to specify the location for those outputs. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Job folders display</i>            </p><ul><li>The folder containing the outputs of an executed analysis has a long name, and contents are displayed in random order. To view job outputs, users can identify the correct folder by locating the folder with the name given to the user at runtime. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Ability to stop a running job</i>            </p><ul><li>Currently, users can delete a job only after it has completed running.  The ability to stop running jobs will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Use of invalid file types for some analyses</i>            </p><ul><li>The tools integrated currently allow for some invalid file types to be selected as inputs. These analyses will execute and invalid or empty files will be generated as outputs. The fix for this issue involves changes to file handling as opposed to a &quot;re-tooling&quot; of the tools included in the DE. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Display of description with outputs</i>            </p><ul><li>The viewer for the outputs contains a tab for the description given by the user at the time of execution, though the entered description currently does not appear in the tab. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Performance</i>            </p><ul><li>Window loading and population of the window with information are not instantaneous. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Inconsistency in the extension for outputs</i>            </p><ul><li>The file extensions applied to the job outputs are not consistent across tools. This is functionality is inherent in the tool itself. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Perpetual running jobs</i>            </p><ul><li>Occasionally, a job may show in Perform Analysis a status of &quot;running&quot; that does not ever reach completion.  This issue is currently being handled and a resolution is being worked on.</li></ul><p><strong>Future endeavors</strong><br /><i>User customized workflows</i>            </p><ul><li>Users will be able to create workflows based upon integrated tools. These workflows will be able to be generated, saved, modified, and shared with groups for future analyses.</li></ul><p><i>Provenance tracking</i>            </p><ul><li>Users will be provided a file that contains details of the analysis being executed. Included in that file will be a description of the parameters used in the analysis, data inputs and the date/time of the execution.</li></ul><p><i>Default value configuration</i>            </p><ul><li>Users will be able to save a selected analysis with parameters that they expect to utilize on different datasets. These values may differ from the default values provided by the author of the original analysis. Users will be able to save their modified version with a name that differs from the original analysis name to indicate that it is unique to their work.</li></ul><p><i>Session-based &quot;Guest&quot; account</i>            </p><ul><li>This will provide users a &quot;preview&quot; of some of  the functionality that is available with a full DE account. It will have limited functionality, such as no way to save work and return to retrieve it later.</li></ul><p><i>Partial saving of parameters</i>            </p><ul><li>Users will be able to save partial entry of parameters to be used for an analysis and run at a later time.</li></ul>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_4" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Data management</h2>		 <p><strong>Improvements from 0.2.1</strong><br /><i>Menu bar</i>      </p><ul><li>Data import and upload were obscured behind a &quot;file&quot; menu. This has been made more apparent to the user by exposing the functionality on a menu bar.</li></ul><p><i>Data management window</i>      </p><ul><li>Categorization of actions a user may wish to perform on data files or folders has begun. This allows for appropriate services to be more efficiently tied to functionality and limiting the user actions to those that are appropriate for the hierarchy selected. The data management window is a work in progress. This issue will be more completely addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues</strong><br /><i>File movement between folders</i>      </p><ul><li>This functionality is currently not supported, but is a high priority on our roadmap. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Expansion of all folders at once</i>      </p><ul><li>This functionality is not enabled with the current view of the Manage Data window. This topic is under discussion for integration.</li></ul><p><i>Upload data from desktop</i>      </p><ul><li>Support for upload from a user's local environment is limited to select data types. Expansion of the data types supported is in the requirements phase. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Import from URL</i>      </p><ul><li>Import from sites with a self-signed certificate fails. A fix for this is being evaluated. Import from the Sequence Read Archive is no longer supported due to a change in their format from fastq to sra. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Display of file size</i>      </p><ul><li>This functionality has not yet been incorporated and is being evaluated.</li></ul><p><i>Sort order of files/folder</i>      </p><ul><li>The sort order of files and folders in the Manage Data window is inconsistent and changes each time the Manage Data window is opened. A fix for this is being evaluated.</li></ul><p><i>Description and file type detection of imported files</i>   </p><ul><li>Users are provided the ability to create a description for their data at import. This functionality is expected in a future release of the DE. Auto detection of file types at import (currently displayed in the Description), is inconsistent as well. Fixes for these issues are being evaluated.</li></ul><p><i>Filter/search</i>      </p><ul><li>The ability to filter or search for particular files in the Manage Data window is currently not available. This functionality is in the requirements phase of development.</li></ul><p>Multiple file import  </p><ul><li>Currently, users can import only one file at a time. A fix for this is in the requirements phase.</li></ul><p><i>Zipped file upload</i>      </p><ul><li>This functionality is in the requirements phase.</li></ul><p><i>Large file deletion/upload</i>      </p><ul><li>This does not work consistently. Fixes are under evaluation.</li></ul><p><i>Import from Phylota</i>      </p><ul><li>There are a number of issues related to the way data is displayed as well as the general import functionality. The import from Phylota fails in the current version of the DE. Improvements are in the planning stages.</li></ul><p><i>Files with duplicate names do not overwrite</i>  </p><ul><li>Duplicate file names will prompt the user with a &quot;do you want to overwrite&quot; message, but the file is not over written, and the newly imported file is ammended with a number.  </li></ul><p><strong>Future plans</strong><br /><i>Data and file management</i>      </p><ul><li>Improvements to data and file management are slated for the next release of the DE. As more issues are reported for the 0.3.0 release, they will be added for evaluation for the Data Management project</li></ul>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_5" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS)</h2>		 <p><strong>New functionality in 0.3.0</strong><br /><i>Desired name selection</i>     </p><ul><li>This application performs exact and fuzzy matching of a list of plant taxonomic names against the TROPICOS database, provided by the Missouri Botanical Gardens, and returns all names within a set variance. When more than one potential match is returned, the user is allowed to select the name that best reflects the intended entered name.</li></ul><p><i>Selected name details</i>     </p><ul><li>The user is also provided links to the TROPICOS database (housed by the Missouri Botanical Gardens) for additional details. The current algorithmic pipeline includes use of the GNI parser (by Dmitry Mozzherin) and TaxaMatch (by Tony Rees).</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues</strong><br /><i>Matching limitations</i>     </p><ul><li>Current implementation allows matching only of genus and species. Work is underway to incorporate matching for full names (family through variety). This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Resolving similar names</i>     </p><ul><li>The current implementation does not provide synonymous resolution of names. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Entry of  taxa that contain families</i>   </p><ul><li>Currently names that are entered directly into the application must NOT contain family names. The application will not work until the GNI parser is able to accept family names.</li></ul><p>Entry of invalid names     </p><ul><li>When a submitted name has not been matched to any accepted name in the database, the submitted name appears in the Unmatched column.  A fix to identify the name as having &quot;no match&quot; will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Multiple same name return with same score</i>     </p><ul><li>The current version of TNRS returns a match only to the name entered, but does not resolve synonyms that exist in the TROPICOS database.  Although this information is available in the database at this time, TNRS returns all names that match the submitted name without regard to synonymy.  To determine the best match, it is recomended that users click the link in the results list to review other matches in the TROPICOS database.</li></ul><p><i>TNRS does not show results in View Analysis window</i>     </p><ul><li>The View Analysis window currently displays a representation of a chosen analysis and its execution for jobs that utilize the Job Execution Framework, a backend service in the Discovery Environment. TNRS is a web service call and does not use this framework to execute. Therefore, it does not appear in the View Analysis window. Results from an execution populate in the Manage Data window with a timestamp. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>TNRS does not use the Notifications framework</i>     </p><ul><li>This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p>TNRS job name     </p><ul><li>The name entered when the user submits the job is not displayed in the Manage Data window with the outputs. The user is able to identify the job only by a timestamp and a description of &quot;Taxamatch Result&quot;. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>TNRS Manage Data window population</i>     </p><ul><li>The results for a TNRS job do not display consistently with other jobs and do not use the jobs execution framework. No folder is generated and the outputs are returned in the Home folder for data in the Manage Data window. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Other matching issues</i>     </p><ul><li>Submitted names cannot be matched to names that are not a part of the TROPICOS database. As a result, algae, fungi, mosses and other groups may not match appropriately in this application. We anticipate this will be fixed with updates to the database with a future release of the DE.</li></ul><p><i>Download of match results</i>     </p><ul><li>Some browsers will request that users turn off pop-up blockers to allow for download of results from the window showing the matched names (selection of the Download button). Selection to download from the Manage Data window does not present this problem; however, the downloaded list from the Manage Data window is a .txt file, whereas the downloaded list from the window displaying the results is a .csv file. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><strong>Future plans</strong><br /><i>Extending full names</i>     </p><ul><li>The algorithm will be extended to allow for matching for full names.</li></ul><p><i>Similar names</i>     </p><ul><li>Synonymous name resolution will be integrated.</li></ul><p><i>Additional sources</i>     </p><ul><li>Sources of data will be added to the database for resolution, and users will be able to specify which sources they would like to check their names against.</li></ul>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_6" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Tree Reconciliation (TR)</h2>		 <p><strong>New functionality in 0.3.0</strong><br /><i>Gene family search</i>    </p><ul><li>This application is used to search for gene families of interest and view a reconciliation of that gene family tree with a species tree that contains those genes. For the first release of this application, a pipeline that includes MUSCLE, TreeBest and PriMETV was described.</li></ul><p><i>Database search</i>    </p><ul><li>Users are able to search the database, which includes gene family clusters identified by John Bowers, by selecting a gene family identifier, GO term, or accession, or by performing a BLAST search for a gene of interest.</li></ul><p><i>Search results and images</i>    </p><ul><li>A listing of gene families is returned that meets the search criteria and can be selected to view an image of the gene, species and fat tree representation of this data.</li></ul><p><i>Download results</i>    </p><ul><li>Users can also download all files associated with that gene family and view a summary of the family details.</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues</strong><br /><i>Search interface</i>    </p><ul><li>The working group has redefined the items that should be available as a search parameter. A rework of this interface is underway to clarify the available options and allow for direct selection of the family for display rather than selection of &quot;View&quot; to select a family.</li></ul><p><i>Tree visualization</i>    </p><ul><li>Fat tree image - Some of the text in this image appears to be cut off. Users can scroll to get the complete image.</li><li>Species tree image - Curved lines are not standard and will be fixed with incorporation of new tree visualization tools.</li><li>Download of images - Images are displayed in one format and are not in the same format at download. A fix for this is in progress.</li></ul><p><i>Saving of data from Details tab</i>    </p><ul><li>Users do not get a notification that data is being saved. Also, save does not work for DNA sequences for Gene Family, Amino Acid Sequences for Gene Family, Multiple Sequence Alignment for Gene Tree (DNA), and Multiple Sequence Alignment for Gene Tree (Amino Acid). This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Interface for folder selection for saving of data</i>    </p><ul><li>This interface is inconsistent with the current look and feel for the Manage Data window. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Saving of NHX files in Manage Data window</i>    </p><ul><li>NHX files are being identified as Nexus files upon saving in the DE and uploading the downloaded file in the DE will also cause the file to be interpreted as a Nexus file.  A fix for this is currently underway.  Download of this file, however, does provide proper NHX format.</li></ul><p><i>Tree visualization of saved NHX files</i>    </p><ul><li>The image displayed by the tree renderer in the DE that is associated with tree files cuts off text for the leaves. This will be fixed with the incorporation of new tree visualization tools. This issue exists for all tree files with lengthy names at the leaves.</li></ul><p><i>Display of GO annotations</i>    </p><ul><li>The full annotation is being truncated. This issue will be addressed in a future release.</li></ul><p><i>Search performance</i>    </p><ul><li>For searches that will provide a large listing of gene families (example: GO term of cytoplasm), performance is not optimal. A fix for this is being discussed.</li></ul><p><strong>Future plans</strong><br /><i>User capabilities</i>    </p><ul><li>The TR application is undergoing a complete rework to enable publication of the 1KP dataset, currently housed at TACC. Included in this rework is a basic/advanced search interface, interactive tree functionality and a more generalized display of details for the user to make an informed decision regarding the gene family of interest.</li></ul><p><i>TreeBest algorithm evaluation</i>    </p><ul><li>A review of the TreeBest algorithm is under way, to determine if this provides the best representation of the reconciliations. The database will also be populated with the data generated by the 1KP group as opposed to the limited subset of data that is currently available. The goal is to provide users with other data the ability to utilize the pipeline for generating reconciliations and loading this data into a uniform schema for visualizations.</li></ul>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_7" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Ultra High Throughput Sequencing (UHTS)</h2>		 <p><strong>New functionality in 0.3.0</strong><br /><i>Converted and split analyses</i>  </p><ul><li>Many analyses that were hard-coded in 0.2.1 used multiple tools to perform extended and complex tasks. All UHTS tools were reformatted from hard-coded inclusion to instead use the new metadata format for tool integration. Then, analyses were rewritten using the new metadata format and split into discrete analyses, each focused on a specific task (often corresponding to a step in a previous analysis). This will allow for greater flexibility when user-defined multi-step analyses functionality is added in a future release.</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues</strong><br /><i>FASTX related analyses are currently available only for single end reads</i>  </p><ul><li>Paired end read analyses are planned.</li></ul><p><strong>Future plans</strong><br /><i>Additional tool integration and created analyses</i>  </p><ul><li>More tools will be integrated and basic analyses for each tool will be created.</li></ul>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_8" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Trait Evolution (TE)</h2>		 <p><strong>New functionality in 0.3.0</strong><br /><i>Ancestral character estimation (ACE)</i>      </p><ul><li>This uses an R-based package called ape, which was installed as a tool using the new metadata method. Then analyses for both continuous and discrete versions of ACE were added to the DE using the new metadata format.</li></ul><p><i>Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (PIC)</i>      </p><ul><li>This analysis was hard-coded as a function in 0.2.1 and was rewritten for 0.3.0 using the new metadata methods for both tool integration and creation of analyses.</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues</strong><br /><i>File parsing</i>      </p><ul><li>Some file formats are not uploading correctly.
