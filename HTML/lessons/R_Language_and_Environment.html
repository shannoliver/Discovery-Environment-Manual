It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity. One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.</p><p>The above description is from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">http://www.r-project.org/</a></p><p>More information about R is available from: <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">http://www.r-project.org/</a></p><p>The tool was identified for inclusion by the iPlant Tree of Life working group for use with ape. The 0.3.x release of the Discovery Environment uses R version 2.12.0.</p>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>		</div>		<div id="LessonPageNav">		  <p></p>		  <ul>		    <li id="LessonPagePrevious"><a href="FASTX-Toolkit.html">Previous Page: FASTX-Toolkit</a> &nbsp;</li>		    <li id="LessonPageCount">Page <strong>37</strong> of <strong>44</strong></li>		    <li id="LessonPageNext"><a href="SAMtools.html">Next Page: SAMtools</a> &nbsp;</li>		    		  </ul>		</div>	</div>	</body></html>
