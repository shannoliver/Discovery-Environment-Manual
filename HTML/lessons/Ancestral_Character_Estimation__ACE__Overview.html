Traits of interest, for example fruit size or the presence of parasite resistance, can therefore be traced back in time along a known phylogeney.</p><p>Estimating ancestral character values is a phylogenetic analysis that can be used to test evolutionary hypotheses like the temporal sequence of evolutionary events or the appearance of adaptive traits. Because ancestral characters values are not observed, it is more rational to consider them as parameters in a model where the character values of recent species are the observed values.</p><p>It is possible to perform both continuous and discrete ancestral character estimations in the Discovery Environment. Both use a software package called ape, which is based on R, to perform estimation based on a fully resolved phylogeny.</p><p>Continuous ancestral character estimation (CACE) assumes that traits evolve according to a Brownian motion process. Under this model, the expected difference between two taxa can be computed as a function of the time separating the taxa from their most recent common ancestor, which is obtained from the phylogenetic tree. Maximum Likelihood is then used to obtain the ancestors' trait values, which minimizes the sum of squared changes along the branches. The output is a table of ancestral trait values and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. These value estimates can be plotted on the phylogenetic tree using a color gradient. Additionally, the function outputs an estimate of the Brownian motion parameter Ïƒ2 and the log likelihood of the model.</p><p>Discrete ancestral character estimation (DACE) describes evolutionary trait changes using a continuous-time Markov model. In this model the probability of change from one state to another depends only on the transition rate and the evolutionary time, which is obtained by the phylogeny. Maximum Likelihood is then used to estimate the transition rates and the proportional likelihoods of the ancestor's states. The output is a table of proportional likelihood for all possible states at the internal nodes. These value estimates can be plotted on the phylogenetic tree using pie charts to represent the likelihoods.  Additionally, the function outputs an estimate of the transition rate with its associated uncertainty and the log likelihood of the model.</p><p>More details about ape can be found at:<br /><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html" target="_blank">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html</a><br /><a href="http://ape.mpl.ird.fr/" target="_blank">http://ape.mpl.ird.fr/</a></p>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>		</div>		<div id="LessonPageNav">		  <p></p>		  <ul>		    <li id="LessonPagePrevious"><a href="Troubleshooting.html">Previous Page: Troubleshooting</a> &nbsp;</li>		    <li id="LessonPageCount">Page <strong>12</strong> of <strong>44</strong></li>		    <li id="LessonPageNext"><a href="Continuous_Ancestral_Character_Estimation__CACE_.html">Next Page: Continuous Ancestral Character Estimation (CACE)</a> &nbsp;</li>		    		  </ul>		</div>	</div>	</body></html>
